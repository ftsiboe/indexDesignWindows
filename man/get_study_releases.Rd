\usage{
get_study_releases(
  owner,
  repository,
  release_tag,
  output_directory = NULL,
  github_token = NULL,
  sleep_seconds = 3,
  max_rounds = 3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{owner}{Character string giving the GitHub repository owner
(e.g., \code{"ftsiboe"}).}

\item{repository}{Character string giving the GitHub repository name
(e.g., \code{"indexDesignWindows"}).}

\item{release_tag}{Character string specifying the GitHub release tag
whose assets should be downloaded.}

\item{output_directory}{Optional character string specifying the local
directory where release assets should be saved. Defaults to
\code{data-raw/releases/{release_tag}}.}

\item{github_token}{Optional GitHub personal access token (PAT).
Passed to \pkg{piggyback} via \code{.token}. Strongly recommended.}

\item{sleep_seconds}{Numeric scalar giving the number of seconds to pause
between individual file downloads. Increasing this value reduces the
likelihood of triggering GitHub rate limits.}

\item{max_rounds}{Integer giving the maximum number of retry rounds.
Each round attempts to download any files still missing locally.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Files are downloaded for their side effects.
}
\description{
Downloads all files attached to a specified GitHub release tag while
\strong{throttling requests} to avoid GitHub rate limits and abuse protection.
This helper is designed for releases containing many or large assets
(e.g., \code{.rds} outputs generated on HPC systems).
}
\details{
The function downloads assets incrementally, pauses between requests,
and retries failed downloads across multiple rounds. Already-downloaded
files are skipped, allowing the function to safely resume after
interruptions or rate-limit errors.

The function:
\enumerate{
\item Constructs a default output directory
(\code{data-raw/releases/{release_tag}}) if none is supplied.
\item Queries GitHub once to obtain the list of release assets.
\item Downloads assets \strong{one at a time} using \pkg{piggyback}.
\item Pauses for \code{sleep_seconds} between downloads to reduce
request bursts.
\item Retries failed or missing downloads for up to \code{max_rounds}.
\item Skips files that already exist locally.
}

This approach is especially useful when GitHub returns repeated
\code{HTTP 403 (Forbidden)} errors during bulk downloads.

Authentication via a GitHub personal access token (PAT) is strongly
recommended, even for public repositories.
