\title{indexDesignWindows: Replication Package: Redesigning Historical Windows in Index-Based Insurance}
\description{
Replication package for a study evaluating alternative historical window designs used to construct the Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage (PRF) rainfall index under the U.S. Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP). The package systematically compares index designs based on varying lengths of historical climate data to assess implications for index stability, spatial equity, indemnity accuracy, and policy performance. It provides reproducible workflows, pre-processed outputs, and visualization tools to support robustness analysis of index-based insurance products in both U.S. and international contexts.
