**Abstract:**

Replication package for a study evaluating alternative historical window
designs used to construct the Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage (PRF)
rainfall index under the U.S. Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP). The
package systematically compares index designs based on varying lengths
of historical climate data to assess implications for index stability,
spatial equity, indemnity accuracy, and policy performance. It provides
reproducible workflows, pre-processed outputs, and visualization tools
to support robustness analysis of index-based insurance products in both
U.S. and international contexts **Keywords:**
