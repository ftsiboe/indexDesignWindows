Description: Replication package for a study evaluating alternative historical window
  designs used to construct the Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage (PRF) rainfall
  index under the U.S. Federal Crop Insurance Program (FCIP). The package
  systematically compares index designs based on varying lengths of historical
  climate data to assess implications for index stability, spatial equity,
  indemnity accuracy, and policy performance. It provides reproducible workflows,
  pre-processed outputs, and visualization tools to support robustness analysis
  of index-based insurance products in both U.S. and international contexts.
